<p>This plug-in instructs Simple DNS Plus to ignore (not answer) all DNS requests that the plug-in processes.</p>

<p>This can be used to ignore requests from specific IP addresses, for specific domain names, record types, etc.<br />
As an example, you could configure it to ignore DNS requests from IP addresses listed by a blacklist plug-in.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: By default this plug-in instructs Simple DNS Plus to ignore ALL DNS requests, so it is important that it be limited in scope using the &quot;DNS Requests&quot; tab:</p>
