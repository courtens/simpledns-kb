<p>Yes - Simple DNS Plus is based on the public standards (RFCs) just like other DNS server programs including &quot;BIND&quot; which is commonly used on Unix/Linux systems.</p>

<p>Simple DNS Plus can import / export DNS zones from / to standard zone files (a.k.a. &quot;master files&quot;) according to RFC standards.<br />
This means that you can exchange zone files / data with other standard based DNS servers.</p>
