<p>CCProxy a product from Youngzsoft - <a href="http://www.youngzsoft.net" target="_blank">http://www.youngzsoft.net</a></p>
<p>CCProxy includes a DNS proxy or mapping function used to relay DNS requests from clients behind the proxy server.<br />
If CCProxy and Simple DNS Plus are running on the same computer, this will conflict as both programs are trying to use port 53.</p>
<p>You can disable the DNS function in CCProxy. You won't need this because Simple DNS Plus provides this functionality directly.</p>
<p>In CCProxy click the Options button:</p>

<p>Un-check "DNS" and click the "OK" button:</p>
<p> <img height="394" src="img/130/2.png" width="452" /></p>
<p>After changing this setting, you should be able to start the DNS service in Simple DNS Plus (select "Start Server" from the "File" menu).</p>
