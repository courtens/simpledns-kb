            <strong>Faster!</strong>
            <br />
            - The DNS engine and internal data structures have been further optimized, so resolving and serving DNS requests is generally much faster.<br />
            - Program startup / loading zones is almost instantaneous even with +100,000 zones because of a new boot file format, and a "load on demand" option for both primary and secondary zones.<br />
            - Managing large zone lists and/or large zones in the GUI is extremely fast compared to earlier versions.<br />
            The DNS Records window now opens and is ready for use in 1-2 seconds even with +100,000 zones, and selecting a zone with +100,000 DNS records also takes just a few seconds.<br />
            - Master/Slave synchronization with many zones is also much more efficient because serial numbers for all zones can now be verified in a single transaction (instead of one per zone).<br />
            - And because v. 5.0 is 100% .NET managed code, it runs as a native 64 bit application on 64 bit Windows/CPUs = SPEED!<br />

            <strong>IPv6</strong>
            <br />
            Simple DNS Plus v. 5.0 has full support for IPv6 - the next Internet Protocol version.<br />
            It has an option to control protocol preference (IPv4 / IPv6) on dual-stack computers, and it can even act as IPv6-to-IPv4 or IPv4-to-IPv6 forwarder.<br />

            <strong>IDNs</strong> (internationalized domain names)<br />
            In version 5.0 you can enter domain names with native characters directly (no punycode conversion needed), and have an option to display native character or punycoded domain names anywhere in the user interface, and quickly switch between these modes.<br />

            Several plug-ins will be provided in the default installation, additional plug-ins will be available for download later, and the plug-in system will be completely open and documented for 3rd parties and users to develop their own.<br />

            The "Quick Zone Wizard" (formerly "Quick Domain Wizard") is template based, and supports multiple templates through a drop-down menu on the Quick button. Templates can simply be static standard RFC based zone files, but they can also become "active" by adding ASP style tags (&lt;%...%&gt;), VB.NET code, and custom input fields. <a href="/kb/116/setting-up-quick-zone-templates">More details...</a><br />
