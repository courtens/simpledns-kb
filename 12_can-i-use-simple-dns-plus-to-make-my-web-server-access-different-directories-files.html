<p>Simple DNS Plus is part of the solution, but you also need a web-server that supports this.<br />
<br />
A URL consists of 3 parts: Protocol (http://), Domain Name (www.domain.com), and Path/File (/somedir/page.htm).<br />
<br />
The Protocol tells the browser how to communicate with the web server.<br />
The Domain Name is used to locate the IP address of the web server (through DNS).<br />
The Path/File is sent to the web server as part of the http request.</p>
<p>When a browser opens a web-page, it first locates the web server's IP address through DNS. This DNS request only contains the Domain Name - not the Path/File.<br />
Second it connects to the web server and sends a HTTP request, which includes both the Domain Name and Path/File.</p>
<p>If the web server supports different domain names, it then serves the page from a directory according to the domain name supplied in the request.</p>
<p>This is supported directly by Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Server) for all current Windows versions - <a href="/kb/144/virtual-hosting-with-iis-internet-information-services">click here to see how</a></p>
<p>There are also several free / inexpensive web servers available that do support it directly on all Windows platforms. For example: </p>
<p>"Apache" <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/" target="_blank">http://httpd.apache.org/</a><br />
This is the "original" and still the most widely used web-server on the Internet.<br />
It is free (or OpenSource), but because it uses text configuration files instead of a GUI, it is probably not the most user friendly choice on Windows.<br />
And it is also supported directly by Apache.<br />
