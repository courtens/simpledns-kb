<p>"Check DNSSEC Signatures" is a free tool which looks up and verifies the DNSSEC signature(s) for the specified record set using the public key found in the related DNSKEY-record(s).<br />
It DOES NOT not verify the DNSKEY against any trust anchors or secure delegations / DS-records (we may add this in a future version).<br />
It supports RSA and DSA signatures, and SHA-1 hashing only (recommend and most common).</p>
<p>We created this tool in order to test our new DNSSEC signing functions in Simple DNS Plus v. 5.2 - mostly because we couldn't find any existing DNSSEC testing tools for Windows.<br />
99% of the program code in this tool comes from Simple DNS Plus, so how do we know that either is working correctly? Simple - we tested the tool against a bunch of DNSSEC signed zones around the Internet, and since this was successful, the signing function in Simple DNS Plus must be working too.</p>
<p>Download <a href="https://simpledns.plus/outbox/chksig.zip">chksig.zip</a> (269 KB) (v. 1.0 build 1)</p>
<p>System requirements: Windows 98/2000 or later + .NET Framework 2.0 or later.</p>
<p>This zip file contains both a Windows GUI version (ChkSigW.exe) and a command line version (ChkSigC.exe) of the same tool.<br />
The command line version returns an exit code 1 if it encounters any problems, so this could be used as part of some automated script to periodically check your zones.</p>
