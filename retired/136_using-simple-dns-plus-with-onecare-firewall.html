<p>OneCare is a product from Microsoft (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/onecare" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/onecare</a>) which includes a firewall and other security functions.</p>
<p>The OneCare firewall monitors network traffic by application (program).</p>
<p>Simple DNS Plus consists of several executable modules, each of which are considered a "program" by OneCare and which must be granted access to the Internet. These modules are:<br />
- "Simple DNS Plus - Core Engine" (sdnsmain.exe)<br />
- "Simple DNS Plus - DNS Look Up" (lookup.exe)<br />
- "Simple DNS Plus - DNS Record Editor" (editrecs.exe)<br />
- "Simple DNS Plus - GUI" (sdnsgui.exe)</p>
<p>The first time you use each of these modules on a computer with OneCare, you should get a messages like this:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Simply click "Allow this program" each time this happens.</p>
<p>The first time you run Simple DNS Plus on a computer with OneCare, you will probably get the following error message:</p>
<p>
<img height="262" src="img/136/2.png" width="486" />
</p>
<p>This should only happen the first time.<br />
After you allow Simple DNS Plus access to the Internet (see above) this should not happen again.<br />
Simply restart Simple DNS Plus, and it should work fine.</p>
<p>If you encounter any problems, in the OneCare user interface, click "Change settings":</p>

Then click the "Advanced" button:</p>
