            <strong>Selective binding.</strong>
            <br />
            You can now specify the exact server IP addresses to serve DNS requests on.<br />
            (Used to be limited to either one IP address or all IP addresses)<br />

            <strong>Offer recursion to multiple IP ranges.</strong>
            <br />
            This option is now a list of IP addresses / subnets, making it possible to specify exactly who should be offered recursion even if you have multiple or "class-less" subnets.<br />

            <strong>Block ranges of IP addresses.</strong>
            <br />
            You can now also block IP addresses (or prevent blocking) by subnet.<br />
            With the recent focus on "denial of service" (DoS) attacks, this becomes an increasingly important feature.<br />
            By specifying a maximum number of requests per second, any client exceeding this will automatically be added to the block list.<br />
            ("IP address blocking" has moved to a separate function in the Tools menu).<br />

            <strong>Support for AAAA-records (IPv6).</strong>
            <br />
            The AAAA record type is the future replacement for A-records, and IPv6 the replacement for the current IP address system (a.k.a. IPv4). Few applications and network devices currently support IPv6, but this is expected to change rapidly.<br />

            <br />
            Another option has been added for integration with custom applications.<br />
            Sample code is now also available. See help file for details.<br />

            <strong>New "Reverse Zone Wizard".</strong>
            <br />
            Forget "in-addr.arpa" and reversing IP address segments.<br />
            With the new wizard you simply specify your IP address range and Simple DNS Plus automatically generates all the necessary records.<br />
            It even supports "classless delegation" for those with less than 256 IP addresses.<br />

            <strong>Easy Zone and Record management.</strong>
            <br />
            The "Quick Domain Wizard" and "Zone Properties" dialogs can now automatically be pre-filled with your preferred defaults making it even easier to manage your DNS configuration.<br />
            Also, the "Record Properties" dialog for A-records now includes an "Update Reverse Zone" option, which automatically generates corresponding reverse records.<br />

            <td>
            <strong>Enhanced DNS Look Up Tool - now with "WHOIS".</strong>
            <br />
            With the new "WHOIS" feature, you can check the details (such as name, address and phone) on the owners of a domain name or IP address.<br />
            The Look Up Tool comes configured with a list of worldwide WHOIS servers, so just like regular DNS look ups - just enter a domain name, and Simple DNS Plus locates the correct server and returns the answer.<br />
            The enhanced Look Up Tool also returns more details on standard DNS queries than in earlier versions.<br />

            SRV-records are used by Windows 2000 directory services, and other recent Internet applications.<br />

            <br />
            Automatically update DNS records on secondary DNS servers.<br />
            Everything is completely automated - when changes are made in the new Record Editor, Simple DNS Plus immediately notifies secondary servers and a Zone Transfer is initiated.<br />
            Simple DNS Plus can also be configured as a secondary DNS server, and will then automatically check for updates on the primary server.<br />
            As everything else in Simple DNS Plus, Zone Transfers are implemented according to the DNS standards (RFCs), and so it is 100% compatible with other standard DNS servers.<br />
