<p>WinRoute Firewall a DNS Forwarder used to relay DNS requests from clients behind the proxy server.<br />
If WinRoute Firewall and Simple DNS Plus are running on the same computer, this will conflict as both programs are trying to use port 53.</p>
<p>You can disable the DNS Forwarder function in WinRoute Firewall. Most likely you won't need this because Simple DNS Plus provides this functionality directly.</p>
<p>To disable the DNS Forwarder in WinRoute Firewall, in the WinRoute Firewall administration console, under "Configuration", select "DNS Forwarder" in the left list, then un-check "Enable DNS forwarding", and click the "Apply" button:</p>

<p>After changing this setting, you should be able to start the DNS service in Simple DNS Plus (select "Start Server" from the "File" menu).</p>
<p>WinRoute Firewall also includes firewall functionality which by default will block DNS requests from the Internet.<br />
