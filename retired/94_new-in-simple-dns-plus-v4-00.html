            <strong>Automatic SPF records - help fight spam and phishing scams</strong>
            <br />
            Simple DNS Plus can now automatically synthesize SPF records for all local zones making it easy to setup and maintain SPF protection for your domains.<br />
            For more on SPF see <a href="http://spf.pobox.com" target="_blank">http://spf.pobox.com</a><br />

            <strong>New option to redirect abusers (synthesize DNS records for unauthorized users)</strong>
            <br />
            When someone (unauthorized) from the Internet tries to resolve outside domain names via your DNS server, Simple DNS Plus can now respond with synthesized (false) DNS records, for example to redirect that person to a signup web-page or similar.<br />
            This feature is also useful when someone is incorrectly pointing their domain registration to your DNS server - for example an ISP customer who has cancelled their account but not changed the domain registration.<br />

            <strong>NAT IP alias conversion</strong>
            <br />
            In DNS responses to LAN clients only, this function changes A-records which are pointing to a public IP address of the NAT router to point to the corresponding private IP address of a local server.<br />
            This way, for example HTTP requests from LAN clients for local web-sites will go directly to the local web-server instead of via the NAT router (which often does not work).<br />

            </strong>You can now specify how long an IP address block should be in effect.<br />
            And you can enter comments for each block, for example about why an IP address was blocked or should not be blocked for easy reference.<br />

            Enter comments for individual DNS records and zones. For example client account numbers, or reminders about what certain records do, etc.<br />
            For DNS records updated dynamically or via DHCP, the comment field will automatically contain a timestamp and other information about the update.<br />
