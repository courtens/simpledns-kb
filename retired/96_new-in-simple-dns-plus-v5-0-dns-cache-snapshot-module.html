<h3>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Faster loading</span>
</h3>
The biggest improvement may be the way this new version of the DNS Cache Snapshot module loads the cache data.<br />
Earlier versions would load all the record names from the cache data directly into the domain name list, which with larger caches could take a long time to complete. This new version initially loads all the cache data into a memory hash table (500,000 entries load in just a few seconds), and then it uses this to populate the domain name list only as needed. Sub-names are not actually loaded into the list until you click [+] to expand a node, and then a progress bar is shown when loading larger lists. But even this typically only takes a few seconds, so with this new version, it is really quite fast to browse through large caches.<br />
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Negative entries</span></h3>
There is a new option to include/exclude negative entries (non-existing records):<br />

<p>A new function to search the cache for specific DNS record names - FAST! (it can search through 500,000 records in only a fraction of a second):</p>
