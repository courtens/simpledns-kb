            <br />
            Someone sending an extreme number of requests in rapid succession may be a hacker trying to crash the server or prevent others from using the service.<br />
            Now the IP address of any client exceeding the maximum allowed requests per second will automatically be added to the "IP address Block List" and ignored until manually removed from the list.</td>

            This makes it easy to control security or abuse problems.</td>

            <strong>Standalone DNS Look Up Tool.</strong>
            <br />
            The DNS Look Up Tool is now a separate program (remains part of the server distribution), so that it can also be used independently from the DNS server.<br />
            It can now be run either from the Simple DNS Plus Tools menu as before or directly from the Windows Start menu.</td>

            <strong>DNS Spoofing Security option added.</strong>
            <br />
            "DNS spoofing" is term used for malicious cache poisoning where forged data is placed in the cache of DNS server.<br />
            Spoofing attacks can cause serious security problems, for example causing users to be directed to wrong Internet sites or e-mail being routed to non-authorized mail servers.<br />
            When the spoofing security option is enabled (default), all records in received DNS answers are checked for authority, and records for which the answering DNS server does not have authority are ignored.</td>

            <strong>Support for TXT-records added.</strong>
            <br />
            TXT-records are used to hold descriptive text. They have no functional purpose to DNS servers or client programs, but are often used to hold general information about a domain name.</td>

            <strong>Support for intranet 'root zone' added.</strong>
            <br />
            When using Simple DNS Plus on an intranet exclusively, you can now define your own 'root zone' and 'root records'.<br />
            (For Internet DNS servers, the root zone/records are automatic).<br />

            <br />
            As both a security and performance measure, you can now select which IP addresses to offer recursion to.<br />
            Non-local computers and DNS servers may try to take advantage of your DNS server by requesting recursion - they shouldn't do this, they don't need to, and now you can prevent it preserving performance and bandwidth for your own users. </td>

            <strong>DNS Cache handling optimized.</strong>
            <br />
            The logic for locating a DNS records in the cache has been changed from searching through the entire cache record by record to an indexed search.<br />
            In a cache with just 500 records, each lookup is now performed about 50 times faster.<br />
            This really speeds up the program, and reduces the load on the CPU.</td>

            <strong>Now with integrated DHCP server.</strong>
            <br />
            Simple DNS Plus can now automatically assign IP-Addresses and other configurations to client computers - and use this same information as DNS records.<br />
            Each client computer already has a host name (the computer name). This is combined with a domain name, and A-Records and PTR-records (reverse lookup) are automatically generated.<br />
            This completely eliminates both manual configuration on client computers AND configuration of DNS records!<br />
            DHCP records can of course be combined with other (static) DNS records, as well as records from the windows "hosts" file.</td>

            The logic for caching of non-existing records has been updated, and Simple DNS Plus can now answer even more requests without asking the outside world first. Another bandwidth saver.</td>

            This option lets external DNS servers handle record resolution thereby saving bandwidth.<br />
            Combined with the DNS caching capabilities of Simple DNS Plus, this may by the fastest possible solution on slow connections.</td>
