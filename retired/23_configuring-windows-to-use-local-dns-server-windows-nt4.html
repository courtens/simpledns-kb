<p>In the "Microsoft TCP/IP Properties" dialog, select the "DNS" tab and under "DNS Service Search Order" click the "Add" button".<br />
Then enter the IP address of the local DNS server (*) in the "TCP/IP DNS Server" box, and click the "Add" button. </p>

<p>Finally click "OK" both in the "Microsoft TCP/IP Properties" and "Network" dialogs to save your changes.</p>
<p>(*) The DNS server IP address must match an IP address that Simple DNS Plus is configured to listen on in the Options dialog / DNS / Inbound Requests section.<br />
If you are configuring the computer which Simple DNS Plus is running on, you can use 127.0.0.1 (the "localhost" address) - otherwise you must use an IP address which is accessible over the local area network. </p>
