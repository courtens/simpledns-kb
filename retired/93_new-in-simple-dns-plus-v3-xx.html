            <strong>TSIG authenticated dynamic DNS updates</strong>
            <br />
            Dynamic DNS updates can now be authenticated using transaction signatures (TSIG).<br />
            This is a method of cryptographically signing the update data with a key name / value pair (similar to a user name / password pair).<br />
            The key name identifies the client to the DNS server, and the key value is a shared secret known only by this client and the DNS server.<br />
            <br />
            This is especially useful when accepting dynamic update from across the Internet, where the originating IP address may not be known beforehand (dynamic IP) and does not guarantee the identity of the sender (IP spoofing).<br />
            <br />
            Different dynamic IP updater applications can be used with this.<br />
            For example <a href="/kb/127/using-dynsite-with-simple-dns-plus">DynSite</a> or <a href="/kb/125/using-directupdate-with-simple-dns-plus">DirectUpdate</a>.<br />
            <br />
            A new product <a href="https://simplefailover.com/" target="_blank">Simple Failover</a> from JH Software also utilizes TSIG authenticated dynamic DNS updates.<br />

            <strong>Domain specific DNS forwarding</strong>
            <br />
            You can now use forwarding to different DNS servers for different domain names.<br />
            You can use this for example if you wish to be able to resolve both Internet domain names as well as a private domain name hosted on another DNS server.<br />
            <br />

            <strong>Extended DNS forwarding</strong>
            <br />
            Standard DNS forwarding is only performed for recursive DNS requests (outgoing requests from local users).<br />
            However Simple DNS Plus now has a unique "extended forwarding" option, which causes non-recursive requests (incoming requests from the Internet) for the specified domain to be forwarded.<br />
            There are several scenarios in which this is beneficial - for example:<br />
            - You are hosting part of your DNS data on a separate DNS server, but you only have one public IP address available for hosting DNS.<br />
            - You are hosting some or all of your DNS data on a separate specialized DNS server (for example an RBL list server) which requires a lot of resources (for example serving data from a database), and you want to offload this by having Simple DNS Plus sit in front of it caching the data, thereby causing fewer requests to hit the specialized DNS server.<br />
            - You are hosting some or all of your DNS data on a separate DNS server which you don't want to expose directly to the Internet (for example if you have to use some other DNS software with known vulnerabilities). Simple DNS Plus will only forward standard DNS requests, only for the specified domain name, and it automatically filters out most malformed data.<br />
            <br />
            In all 3 scenarios, you can setup Simple DNS Plus on a computer with both a private IP address and a public IP address (or with a public IP address NAT mapped to it), setup the other DNS server on a private IP address only, and configure Simple DNS Plus to use extended forwarding for domains hosted on the other DNS server.<br />
            <br />

            <strong>"Stealth DNS" security option</strong>
            <br />
            A hacker may use a software utility known as a "port scanner" to search for potential targets. This software sends dummy requests to a range of IP addresses on different service ports simply to register which addresses/ports respond.<br />
            Any addresses/ports that responded will then be probed further for possible vulnerabilities.<br />
            Simple DNS Plus now has a special "stealth" option which makes it invisible to such port scanners, by not responding to a DNS request unless it is for data in local zones or originates from a client offered recursion.<br />

            <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
            <br />
            Many areas of the algorithms for processing DNS requests have been further optimized. For example duplicate DNS requests (client resending request while the server still working on original request) are now recognized and ignored.<br />

            <strong>Separation of DNS engine and GUI = Access via Terminal Services</strong>
            <br />
            Simple DNS Plus runs on a lot of Windows 2000 servers, and a lot of these servers are being administered remotely via Windows Terminal Services (a.k.a. "Remote Desktop"). The problem is that when you connect to a remote Windows 2000 Server using Terminal Services, you are accessing a new "user session" rather than the "console session". When run as a Windows Service (a.k.a. NT-service), Simple DNS Plus (and its tray icon) "lived" in the console session, and was therefore not directly accessible through the Terminal Services session. Workarounds for this were described on our website, but were not exactly convenient or intuitive.<br />
            Separating the DNS engine (the service part) from the user interface solves this and others issues - including conflicts with both Office 2000 and ZoneAlarm which led to some annoyance for many users. </td>

            <strong>NXDOMAIN Redirect<br />
            </strong>Typically when you open a non-existing domain name in a web-browser, you either get an error page, or you are redirected to some search web-site controlled by the web-browser company (or DNS registry).<br />
            This of course happens all the time because of misspellings and bad links on web-sites.<br />
            Now you can take advantage of those failed requests (from any client configured to use your DNS server) by redirecting them to your web-server instead of giving this traffic to the browser companies.<br />
            This new option redirects all recursive DNS requests for non-existing domain names to a server IP address which you control.<br />
            This gives you a unique opportunity to present your own custom search page, a domain sale offer, a marketing message, an intranet site, or anything else you can think of.<br />
            Note: Only requests which are for domain names confirmed non-existing (NXDOMAIN) will be redirected - not any other error type conditions.<br />
            The new option is available in the Options dialog / DNS Records tab.</td>

            </strong>Many users have asked for more options to control log files.<br />
            One problem is that Simple DNS Plus can generate some real big log files in no time, which can quickly fill up even moderately sized hard drives.<br />
            We&rsquo;ve added options to generate log files per hour, day, or month - and these can now be recycled every day, month, or year (overwriting the oldest file first).<br />

            To prevent this Simple DNS Plus the maximum number of inbound TCP connections can be set (default to 100). After this number of connections has been reached, additional connection attempts are logged and rejected.<br />

            <strong>Interoperability<br />
            </strong>It is now possible to use the automatic Master/Slave zone synchronization function (added in version 3.20) with other DNS server software.<br />
            No other DNS server software has this functionality built-in, and it still much easier to use with Simple DNS Plus on both the master and slave server.<br />
            But now it is possible to manually &ldquo;fake&rdquo; a &ldquo;_masterlist&rdquo; zone on any standard DNS server, and have a Simple DNS Plus slave server synchronize with that.<br />
            Another new option can prevent Simple DNS Plus from requesting &ldquo;incremental zone transfers&rdquo; (IXFR) from other DNS servers.<br />
            IXFR is more efficient than the &ldquo;full zone transfer&rdquo; (AXFR) alternative, but some DNS server software packages do not support IXFR.<br />
            So if you are using another brand software which doesn&rsquo;t understand IXFR as your primary DNS server, you can now save some wasted communication (IXFR request / Don&rsquo;t understand response) between the two servers. </td>

            Several users have described scenarios where this automatic updating may not be desirable - for example when multiple computers on the same network should be allowed to have the same computer name.<br />
            So now there is an option to turn this on and off in the Options dialog, DHCP tab.</td>

            <br />
            You can now specify exactly where data (boot and zone files) and logs should be kept on your system.<br />
            Just like with other log files, system performance can be enhanced by writing log files to a different physical disk drive (other than where the operating system is installed).<br />

            <br />
            Enabling this option will delay loading of primary zones until the first related request is received.<br />
            In setups with many zones (+500), this can greatly improve the server startup time.<br />
            Inactive zones will never be loaded, which in some situations may improve memory consumption.<br />

            This release automatically formats the files for better readability, and supports standard zone files options and a few BIND specifics:<br />
            - Escape characters: ()\@<br />
            - Directives: $ORIGIN, $TTL<br />
