<p>The Simple DNS Plus users interface (GUI) uses transition effects for menus and tool tips (sliding / fading) for nice visual effects when this is enabled in Windows.<br />
However if you are accessing the server computer remotely through a slower connection (less than LAN speed) you may want to disable these effects for faster access.</p>
<p>Right-click anywhere on the remote desktop and select "Properties" from the popup-menu.</p>
<p>In the Display Properties dialog, select the "Appearance" tab, and then click the "Effects" button:</p>
<p> <img height="448" src="img/111/1.png" width="404" /></p>
<p>UN-check the "Use transition effects for menus and tool tips" option and click OK:</p>
<p> <img height="309" src="img/111/2.png" width="414" /></p>
<p>If the option is disabled like this: </p>
<p> <img height="102" src="img/111/3.png" width="414" /></p>
<p>- then you need to disconnect the remote session and connect again with the Remote Desktop / Experience / "Menu and window animation" option ENABLED, and then repeat above:</p>
<p> <img height="465" src="img/111/4.png" width="411" /></p>
<p>The next time you use Remote Desktop you can change the Experience options back to whatever you need.</p>
