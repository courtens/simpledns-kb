<p>Yes, Simple DNS Plus supports both the "SRV" record type (required for AD) and "dynamic updates" (makes configuration with AD much easier).</p>
<p>The Windows Server will attempt to create the necessary DNS records through DNS dynamic updates - so by enabling this for the zone in which your network belongs, everything should be automatic.</p>
<p>To enable dynamic updates, in the Simple DNS Plus main window, click the "Records" button:</p>

<p>Right-click a zone and select "Properties" from the pop-up menu:</p>

<p>Select the "Dynamic Updates" tab, check "Accept Standard Dynamic Update requests", and make sure the Windows server IP address is included:</p>

Or you can add the required DNS records manually - but this can difficult, and we highly recommend the automatic setup through dynamic updates.<br />

<p>Note: Simple DNS Plus does not store its own data in Active Directory.</p>
