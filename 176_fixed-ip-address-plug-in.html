<p>This plug-in serves a fixed IP address (IPv4 and/or IPv6) to all DNS requests for host records (A/AAAA).<br />
This can be used as a simple way to host DNS records.</p>

<p>WARNING: By default, this plug-in responds to ALL requests for A/AAAA records. It is therefore important to limit which DNS requests are processed using the settings in the &quot;DNS Requests&quot; tab.</p>

<p>On the &quot;Plug-In Settings&quot; tab, enter the IP address(es) and TTL value to respond with.<br />
At least one of the IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) must be specified, but the other can be left blank:</p>
