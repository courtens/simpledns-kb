To do this, you need to add NS-records for the sub-domain name pointing to the&nbsp;host names of the DNS servers hosting the sub-domain -&nbsp; in the parent zone.<br />
<br />
In the "DNS records" window right-click the parent zone in the left list and select "New NS-record":<br />
<br />

In the "New NS-record" dialog, enter the sub-domain name and the host name of one of the DNS servers hosting the sub-domain:<br />
<br />

<br />
Repeat the previous steps, so that you have an NS-record for each DNS server hosting the sub-domain:<br />

<br />
Note that it is important that matching A-records exist for&nbsp;DNS server host names&nbsp;listed in these NS-records.<br />
For&nbsp;the example above, A-records must exist for "ns1.otherdomain.com" and "ns2.otherdomain.com" - in the "otherdomain.com" zone on whatever DNS server is hosting "otherdomain.com".<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;the DNS server host names are themselves sub-names of the domain name&nbsp;being delegated, it is necessary to&nbsp;include a copy of&nbsp;these A-records in the parent zone. These are called "glue records".<br />
Otherwise other DNS servers will have no way to find the sub-domain's DNS servers, and therefore no way to resolve records in the sub-domain.<br />
In the&nbsp;screen shot below, the highlighted A-records are such "glue records":<br />
