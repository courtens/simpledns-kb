<p>Whenever you enter a domain name without any dots (unqualified) in a browser, in Windows Explorer, and in most other places, the Windows operating system will always attempt to "complete" the domain name by adding a "DNS suffix" to this.</p>
<p>So if your computer uses a DNS suffix "mydomain.com", and you enter "webserver" in the browser, Windows will try to resolve this as "webserver.mydomain.com".<br />
This would then be resolved correctly if your DNS server (Simple DNS Plus) is configured with a zone "mydomain.com" and an A-record for "webserver.mydomain.com" in this zone.</p>
<p>Make sure that all the client computers on your LAN are configured with the same DNS suffix(es).</p>
<p>See the reference articles below for details on how to configure DNS suffixes.</p>
<p>NOTE: Computers configured to get their IP address from a DHCP server ("obtain IP address automatically") will typically get the DNS suffix from the DHCP server.</p>
