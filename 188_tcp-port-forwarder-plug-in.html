<p>This plug-in provides simple TCP port forwarding.</p>

<p>If the Simple DNS Plus computer is connected to both the Internet and to a private network (LAN), this can be used to forward connections from the Internet to a computer on the LAN. For example mapping remote desktop connections (port 3389).</p>

<p>On the &quot;Plug-In Settings&quot; tab, enter the following settings (explained below the image):</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Listen on IP address</strong><br />
	The local IP address that the plug-in should listen for incoming connections on.</li>
	<li><strong>Listen on TCP port </strong><br />
	The local TCP port number that the plug-in should listen for incoming connections on.</li>
	<li><strong>Connect to host </strong><br />
	The server host name or IP address that connections should be forwarded to.</li>
	<li><strong>Connect to TCP port </strong><br />
	The server TCP port that connections should be forwarded to.</li>
	<li><strong>Max. connections</strong><br />
	The maximum number of connections that can be forwarded at the same time.</li>
	<li><strong>Idle time-out</strong><br />
	If enabled, the connection will be closed if no data has been sent in either direction for this legth of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>TheTCP Port Forwarder plug-in also has a &quot;view&quot; in the main Simple DNS Plus window (open from View menu), where you can see current and total number of connections, and the total bytes transferred:</p>

<p>The Simple DNS Plus log (Active Log View and log files) will show when individual connections are accepted and closed:</p>

<p>Note that this plug-in does not provide any DNS records or any other functionality related to directly to DNS. But you can of course point domain names to the IP address that the plug-in listens for connections on, using A-records provided through local zones or other plug-ins.</p>
