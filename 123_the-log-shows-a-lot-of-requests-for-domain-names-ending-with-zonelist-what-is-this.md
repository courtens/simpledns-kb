<p>These requests typically come from a Simple DNS Plus server configured as a &quot;super slave&quot; server in order to automatically update its list of secondary zones.<br />
This is a special feature of Simple DNS Plus to fully automate secondary servers.<br />
To work correctly, this must be activated in the Options dialog / DNS / Local Zones / Zone Transfers section&nbsp;on both &quot;super master&quot; and &quot;super slave&quot; servers, so they &quot;know&quot; each other.</p>
